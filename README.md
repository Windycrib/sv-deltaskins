## Introduction

This repository provides skins for the **Delta Emulator** app. The skins are designed to enhance your gaming experience, with, for example, **Light** and **Dark** themes for the **Nintendo DS**.  
Additionally, the skins are optimized to make the most out of the available screen space, ensuring a better and more immersive experience.

Each **Skin** is designed to support both **portrait** and **landscape** orientations.

## How to Install

1. Download the desired **deltaskin** file and save it on your device (you can manage it through the **File** app).
2. Open the **Delta** app on your device.
3. Tap on the '⚙️' icon to go to **Settings**, and under **Controller Skins**, tap on the desired console.
4. Tap on the image of **Portrait** or **Landscape** to go to the corresponding section.
5. Tap the '➕' icon in the top right corner and choose the downloaded **deltaskin** file.
6. The skins will now appear in both the **Portrait** and **Landscape** sections. Tap on the desired skin in each section to apply it.
7. Enjoy your enhanced gaming experience!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *For each skin, the version with the swapped (inverted) screens is available, marked with 'Swap'. Both the normal and Swap versions can be added, and you can select the desired version directly from Delta.*

> [!TIP]
> *Delta allows you to choose a separate skin for each orientation. For instance, if you prefer a **Light** skin for **portrait** and a **Dark Swapped** skin for **landscape**, you can download and install both skins. Then, from within Delta, you can select which skin to apply to each orientation individually.*
